Child:
121. Harold Porter

Thomas was the second son of William and Elizabeth
(Kenney) Porter. He and his brother David drew
bricks for their family home on the homestead, Lot
16, Concession 10. They got bricks from two kilns
at Lot 15, Concession 10 (Snider's Corners  now
Bethesda) and at Lot 17, Concession 6. These kilns
were operated by James Lowe. (Note 2)

Georgina Nesbitt was a younger sister of Ellen
Nesbitt Kerr, grandmother of Mary Schulz (#116).

Thomas and Georgina Porter bought 150 acres of Lot
15, Concession 10 of St. Vincent Township in 1889.
In August 1886, they donated the northwest corner
of this farm (85x15O feet) to the trustees of St.
John's Methodist Church. Thomas served on the
building committee and also held the office of
secretarytreasurer of St. John's for a period of
time.

After Harold's death in 1891, Thomas sold the farm
in 1893 and moved west to Parksville, British
Columbia. Georgina moved to Owen Sound and lived
in one of the houses that Thomas had built.

Thomas Porter was a carpenter by trade and built
two houses in the Brooke district of Owen Sound,
Ontario. One house, located at 2069  5th Ave. W.,
he left to his nephew John (#114) who in turn gave
it to Trinity United Church and First United Church,
Owen Sound, on the condition it not be sold. The
other house, located at 2056 - 4th Ave. W., he left
to Mrs. Sam Walter, who looked after his wife
Georgina. Both houses are standing today.

Thomas was a ratepayer with St. Johns School as this
is where his son Harold attended.

George Henry Arthur was the son of John Arthur, Sr.,
a farmer and a Justice of the Peace, according to

the Biographical Directory of Grey County
Subscribers in the Historical Atlas of Grey and
Bruce Counties, 1880 (H. Belden and Co., Publishers).
John Arthur was born in County Tyrone, Ireland in
1803 and settled in Grey County in 1859. He owned
Lots 20 and 21, Concession 9 of St. Vincent

Township at a value of $10,000 for 200 acres.

George Henry Arthur bought 100 acres, Lot 20,
Concession 10 (the south half of the lot) in 1866
from his father. In the Historical Atlas, this
property was valued at $6,000 in 1880.

George and Sarah Jane Arthur later moved to Lot 17,
Concession 11 of St. Vincent Township. He purchased
100 acres (the south half of the lot) in 1888 from
Nathan Seaman. This farm was known as Fairview
Grange. The date of their move is not exactly known,
although it may have been in 1889. The reason for
my guess is that George Arthur was a ratepayer of
S.S. #12 (known as Streets School or Bumstead's
School) in 1889. He was also a ratepayer of S.S. #11
(St. John's School) in 1889. All their children
attended one or both schools. (Note 3)

Other Chronicles, pages 154 and 145.

On Fairview Grange (Lot 17, Concession 11) is a
beautiful stone house which still stands as a
sentinel on the hill, overlooking the countryside
facing the town of Meaford. Thhs house was built
in 1867. The original barn was destroyed by fire
in the 1960s and a new one has been built.

George Henry Arthur sold Lot 20, Concession 10 to
his son Orville J. Arthur in 1910. Orville sold

it to his brother George Frederick in 1912. George
Frederick later sold it to John W. Jolley in 1920.
This farm (Lot 20, Concession 10) was in the George
Henry Arthur family name for 59 years. The house
on this farm was destroyed by fire in the 1960s.

In 1911, George Henry Arthur sold Lot 17, Concession
11 to two of his sons - the west or back half (50
acres) to George Frederick Arthur, the east or front
half (50 acres) to Bernard Stanley Arthur. In 1912
George F. Arthur sold his part of the farm to Bernard
Arthur. Bernard owned the whole farm until 19#8

when he and his son sold it to Frederick I. Genoe,
who in turn sold it in 1949 to Clarence Whitfield.
This farm (Lot 17, Concession 11) was in the Arthur
family name for 60 years.

In the 1871 St. Vincent Township census George

family farm (Lot 17, Concession 12 St. Vincent
Township). Robert and Ethel lived on this farm
after their marriage, building a second part on
the house. They had an agreement with Robert's
father to supply him with staples, etc. When his
father died, Robert paid each family member a
specified sum and the farm was his. The farm was
sold to Clarence Fligg and his family after Robert
Arthur Jolleys death in 1957. Robert took an
active part in agricultural matters and educational
circles. He was also a devout church worker with
the Gospel Workers. His obituary states "he was
highly esteemed, and a man with whom it was a

pleasure to know and associate". Robert and Ethel
