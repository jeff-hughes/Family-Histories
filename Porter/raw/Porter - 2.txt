Thomas was the second son of William and Elizabeth (Kenney) Porter. He and his brother David drew bricks for their family home on the homestead, Lot 16, Concession 10.

Georgina Nesbitt was a younger sister of Ellen Nesbitt Kerr, grandmother of Mary Schulz (#116).

Thomas and Georgina Porter bought 150 acres of Lot 15, Concession 10 of St. Vincent Township in 1884. In August 1886, they donated the northwest corner of this farm (85&times;15O feet) to the trustees of St. John's Methodist Church. Thomas served on the building committee and also held the office of secretary-treasurer of St. John's for a period of time.

After Harold's death in 1891, Thomas sold the farm in 1893 and moved west to Parksville, British Columbia. Georgina moved to Owen Sound and lived in one of the houses that Thomas had built.

Thomas Porter was a carpenter by trade and built two houses in the Brooke district of Owen Sound, Ontario. One house, located at 2069 &ndash; 5th Ave. W., he left to his nephew John (#114) who in turn gave it to Trinity United Church and First United Church, Owen Sound, on the condition it not be sold. The other house, located at 2056 &ndash; 4th Ave. W., he left to Mrs. Sam Walter, who looked after his wife Georgina. Both houses are standing today.

George Henry Arthur was the son of John Arthur, Sr., a farmer and a Justice of the Peace, according to the Biographical Directory of Grey County Subscribers in the <u>Historical Atlas of Grey and Bruce Counties, 1880</u> (H. Belden and Co., Publishers). John Arthur was born in County Tyrone, Ireland in 1803 and settled in Grey County in 1859. He owned Lots 20 and 21, Concession 9 of St. Vincent Township at a value of $10,000 for 200 acres.

George Henry Arthur bought 100 acres, Lot 20, Concession 10 (the south half of the lot) in 1866 from his father. In the Historical Atlas, this property was valued at $6,000 in 1880.

George and Sarah Jane Arthur later moved to Lot 17, Concession 11 of St. Vincent Township. He purchased 100 acres (the south half of the lot) in 1888 from Nathan Seaman. This farm was known as Fairview Grange. The date of their move is not exactly known, although it may have been in 1889. The reason for my guess is that George Arthur was a ratepayer of S.S. #12 (known as Street's School or Bumstead's School) in 1889. He was also a ratepayer of S.S. #11
(St. John's School) in 1889. All their children attended one or both schools. (Note 3)

Note 3: <u>History of the Schools of St. Vincent Township and Other Chronicles</u>, pages 154 and 145.

On Fairview Grange (Lot 17, Concession 11) is a beautiful stone house which still stands as a sentinel on the hill, overlooking the countryside facing the town of Meaford. Thhs house was built in 1867. The original barn was destroyed by fire in the 1960s and a new one has been built.

George Henry Arthur sold Lot 20, Concession 10 to his son Orville J. Arthur in 1910. Orville sold it to his brother George Frederick in 1912. George Frederick later sold it to John W. Jolley in 1920. This farm (Lot 20, Concession 10) was in the George Henry Arthur family name for 54 years. The house on this farm was destroyed by fire in the 1960s.

In 1911, George Henry Arthur sold Lot 17, Concession 11 to two of his sons &ndash; the west or back half (50 acres) to George Frederick Arthur, the east or front half (50 acres) to Bernard Stanley Arthur. In 1912 George F. Arthur sold his part of the farm to Bernard Arthur. Bernard owned the whole farm until 1948 when he and his son sold it to Frederick I. Genoe, who in turn sold it in 1949 to Clarence Whitfield. This farm (Lot 17, Concession 11) was in the Arthur family name for 60 years.

They owned 100 acres of Concession 10, Lot 20, of which 70 acres were improved. The farm had 1 house, 2 barns and stables, 1 carriage and sleigh, 2 waggons and sleds, 1 plough and cultivator, 1 fanning mill.

Robert and Ethel lived on this farm after their marriage, building a second part on the house. They had an agreement with Robert's father to supply him with staples, etc. When his father died, Robert paid each family member a specified sum and the farm was his. The farm was sold to Clarence Fligg and his family after Robert <u>Arthur</u> Jolley's death in 1957. Robert took an active part in agricultural matters and educational circles. He was also a devout church worker with the Gospel Workers. His obituary states "he was highly esteemed, and a man with whom it was a pleasure to know and associate". Robert and Ethel had six children &ndash; an infant son who died at birth, Robert <u>Arthur</u>, George <u>Kenneth</u> Falconer, William <u>Frederick</u>, Muriel Irene, Harold Porter Jolley. After Robert's death, Ethel moved to her daughter Muriel's home. Robert Jolley was a ratepayer for St. John's School, where all his children attended. Several of his children became school teachers.
