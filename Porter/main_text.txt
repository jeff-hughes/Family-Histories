<h2>HISTORY OF THE PORTERS</h2>
1949

William Porter, the grandfather of the George H. Arthur family, the Atkins, the Frees and the Porters was born December 28, 1821 in Wiltshire, England sailing from Bristol England as a young man for Canada taking either eight or eleven weeks to cross the ocean. He had two sisters but they never came to Canada. He worked for Hiram Bond on the 9th Line North of St. Vincent for eight dollars a month. This was the highest wage paid at that time. He borrowed money from a Mr. McKnight in Owen Sound. He went over there to make payments. The McKnights invited him to stay for dinner. The girl that worked in the home was Elizabeth Kenney. Later she became William Porter's wife.

Elizabeth Kenney was born on May 15, 1823 in Donegal, Ireland &ndash; an only child and was a servant in the Old Land. She and her mother came out here when she was around seventeen. She was raised an Anglican but later became a Methodist. She walked from either Barrie or Collingwood to Owen Sound where she worked for Mr. McKnight.

One time Mr. Porter went to see his sweetheart thinking it was Sunday, but as there were no calenders, he missed the count and it was Monday. She said "Why William where have you been? I was wearing for you."

On May 18, 1846 William Porter and Elizabeth Kenney were married. The farm on which Herb lives was their land taken from the Crown in 1846. They lived in a little log cabin southwest of the present house. When they started to farm all they had was a shilling and an axe. The table, chairs, sap buckets, spiles were all homemade whittled with a
jack knife. The cradle for the eldest, at least, was a sap-trough, a log cut in two and hollowed out.

There were always Indians lurking around. The road was only a trail like a cow path through the bush.

In those early days they had logging bees. The men, taking a team of oxen went to help the neighbours clear the land. Oxen were handier to use in bush as they did not snag themselves; only the chain to carry. The women went along for a sewing bee. In earlier days there were fine tucks down the front of the men's white shirts. Grandma Porter was an expert needlewoman and she was given the task of making these fine tucks by hand as there were no machines.

For fruit, there were wild berries growing in the clearing. These were preserved with maple sugar in stone crocks.

Grandfather took whatever he could carry of wheat to Barrie; have it ground into flour, and carry it home again. Sometimes he would take the oxen and other times walk going one day and coming home the next. It is sixty-five miles to Barrie from here. He would get tea too.

Around seventy years ago Harry Arthur can remember when they had six horses, a yoke of oxen and some big cows. The end of the cow's horn was sawn off and a brass knob screwed on to keep them from hooking. This is the only place H. Arthur ever saw them.

The present house was built in 1865 when Herb's father was four years old. The contractor was J. J. Johnson. He came from down the country. This was the first work he had done around here. Before he was through he had a number of contracts ahead of him so he moved to Meaford. When they finished building the house the contractors built the cupboard, which we got from the Aunt Ellen estate, and gave it to grandmother as a present.

Where the driving shed now stands there was a building to house implements and horses. The old barn was all on one floor. The present horse stable was built around 1900 when William was two years old.

The barn was built while grandfather William was living. Isaac Porter planed all the lumber in the horse stable and driving shed the winter before they were built.

Grandfather and grandmother had eight children &ndash; having seven children in nine years.

Grandfather and his daughter, Sarah Jane, went to the Quaker church on one horse. This church was a half mile north on the 9th Line of the Meaford Highway on the east side of the road. When they had their meetings they never spoke till the Spirit moved them.

In later years Grandma never combed her own hair. It did not matter how busy Ellen was, she would always stop to comb her mother's hair.

When Grandad wished to teasehis wife he called her Betty. Then she got riled and he chuckled to himself.

She was a short stout woman while her husband was only a medium height around 5'8". His son Isaac resembled him.

They were very fond of the grandchildren. The grandmother never left home for a long time before she died. Mary Arthur, later Mrs. A.L. Shunk, used to get up on a stool and comb the grandad's hair &ndash; it was in the long English style, and put ribbons on it. To entertain Grace, one day, the grandmother went for a ride in the phaeton &ndash; much like a buggy, only it had mud guards on the wheels and lights from tallow candles. They went around and around the field behind the barn while Grace did the driving.

At Christmas time every chimney had smoke coming from it as a sign of hospitality. The families would all come home for Christmas. In later years two families came home, maybe the Atkins and the Frees one year and the Arthurs and Tom Porters the next year. The older folk would eat in the dining room and the younger in the kitchen.

William Porter was offered lots 8 and 9 Concession ll of St. Vincent consisting of 600 acreas for $600.00 or a $1.00 an acre. But grandmother said, "No you cannot put the boys on that place for it won't grow wheat." Wheat was considered the staple crop worth $1.00 a bushel.

Both could read and write. The grandmother spent a good deal of time knitting; was very quick; rather severe, but good judgment. The grandfather was a mild man but very firm. When she died she left a grain sack of socks for Isaac. A blue pair the boys wore last summer were Isaac's wedding socks &ndash; their grandfather.

Grandfather died in June 4, 1886.

St. John's Church was built in 1886 on Thomas Porter's property. Grandmother was asked to name the Church. She named it St. John's after her son John who had died from typhoid fever in 1869 at the age of seventeen years and three months.

Church was attended regularly by every member of the household and family worship was held in the home. No newspapers were read in the home on Sundays even in Herb's earlier days. Every Sunday Herb's mother taught them the Sunday School lesson before they went to Sunday School. Bible truths were taught very impressively in those early days.

The grandmother put potatoes on to boil, take her Bible and study a chapter. By the time the potatoes were cooked she had memorized the chapter. In the speller she went over a long column, closed the book and then repeated the whole column.

After Isaac was married, the mother and Ellen lived in the dining room sleeping in the room off it. Her favourite spot was a rocking chair in front of the west window. Grandfather's clock was north of the west window and the cupboard in the southwest corner.

Grandmother died in May 17, 1909 and was buried in the same grave as her mother who died in her early eighties in Duxbury's Cemetery.

To give you a picture of William and Elizabeth's standing, we have included the Agricultural Censuses for 1851, 1861, and 1871. Note the progression of land clearance during each decade. They grew their own produce and likely used some of it for barter.

Notes from census &ndash; Owing to the wet season, the pea, Indian corn and potato crops are generally bad, almost a total failure. In many instances, squirrels and birds destroyed the crops, especially in small clearings. The land in most parts of the township is well watered by creeks and living springs. Many of these * may appear incorrect but the reason is they milked more cows in summer than they have to give in at this time. Census Taker.

July 26, 1909 (1910 on stone) at his home, Lot 18, Concession 11, St. Vincent Township, m. ________________ 1895 Meaford, Ontario; Georgina Maria Kerr b. October 10, 1866 Meaford, Ontario, d. June 16, 1951 Calgary, Alberta. David is buried in Lakeview Cemetery,
Meaford, Ontario. Georgina is buried in Queen's Park, Calgary, Alberta.

Children:
111. Infant son, unnamed
112. Karl William Porter
113. Bernice Kerr Porter
114. John (Jack) Porter
115. Georgina (Jean) Eleanor Porter
116. Mary E. Porter

David was the oldest son of William and Elizabeth (Kenney) Porter. He and his brother Thomas drew bricks for their family home on the homestead, Lot 16, Concession 10. They got bricks from two kilns at Lot 15, Concession 1O (Snider's Corners &ndash; now Bethesda) and at Lot 17, Concession 6. These kilns were operated by James Lowe. (Note 1)

Note 1: <u>History of the Schools of St. Vincent Township and Other Chronicles, 1847-1967</u>. P. 246

Georgina's parents were William and Ellen (Eleanor) Nesbitt Kerr, both from the Oshawa area. They married and moved to Meaford, settling in a log house on the 11th Concession near the Big Head River (about 5 miles from Meaford). Mrs. Kerr was 17 when she married and died in 1939 at 101 years. Both Mr. &amp; Mrs. Kerr are buried in Lakeview
Cemetery. Some of their children were Georgina Maria, Olive and Harry.

David and Georgina Porter bought a 200 acre farm, Lot 18, Concession 11, St. Vincent Township in 1885. The farm was called Bayview. (This corner is still referred to as Bayview today.) David left the farm to his wife in his will.

Before David died, a man by the name of Alfred Jeffrey (born 1882) came to Canada from England on a sight-seeing trip. Mr. Jeffrey learned of David's illness, and, although he was not a farmer, he agreed to help the family. He stayed over five years. He married Olive Kerr (a sister of Georgina) and they moved to Calgary, Alberta.

After David's death, Georgina rented the farm out, as she felt it was too much responsibility for her children, and moved to Meaford, Ontario to 142 St. Vincent Street.

In 1936, 0.054 acres was taken off the front edge of the farm for widening of the highway. In 1942, Georgina Porter sold the farm to Mr. Elmer Scarrow. (This farm was in the Porter name for 57 years.)

All the children attended St. John's School at Lot 16, Concession 11. After Georgina moved to Meaford, the children attended Meaford Public School and Meaford High School.

David and Georgina's first child, a son, died at birth and was buried on their farm, as this was permissible in those days.

Karl William Porter was born on his parents' farm (Lot 18, Concession 11) in 1896. He went west by train in 1913 when he was 17 to live with his Uncle Harry Kerr on their ranch in Medicine Hat, Alberta. He stayed there for several years, then started farming on his own. His sister Mary notes that he loved the farm, and especially his animals.

Bernice, born in 1898 on the farm (Lot 18, Concession 11) was not too well in health and lived with her grandparents, William and Ellen Nesbitt Kerr, in Meaford, Ontario. She went west to visit Alfred and Olive Jeffrey in Calgary on her first holidays in about 1916. There she got a job with the Alberta Government Telephones as a telephone operator and stayed out west. In Vulcan, Alberta, Bernice met William Herman, who had a dray and taxi
business there. They married and were dairy farmers in Vulcan, Alberta area, then moved to Black Diamond, Alberta to operate a dairy.

John (Jack) Porter was born on the farm in 1900. He went to Medicine Hat, Alberta by train in 1916 to live with his Uncle Harry Kerr. He spent some time as a time keeper in a mine in British Columbia, then a grain buyer in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. He was a member of the United Church and the Masonic Lodge.

Georgina (Jean) Porter was born on the farm in 1902 and attended St. John's School, Meaford Public School, Meaford High School and Owen Sound Business College.

She worked for a while as a bookkeeper at a men's furnishings store in Owen Sound, then moved to Detroit, Michigan and later to Newark, New Jersey. She was self-employed, selling ladies', men's and children's ready-to-wear clothing.

Mary was born in 1904 at Bayview, attended St. John's School for a short time with Bill Porter and Edith Jolley. She finished school in Meaford. She and her mother went west to visit her brothers in about 1921 and both stayed. She still lives in Calgary, Alberta. Mary's grandmother, Mrs. William (Ellen) Kerr, formerly of Meaford, and then living
in Calgary, was present at Mary and William Schulz's wedding in Central United Church, Calgary. Mrs. Kerr was 96 years of age and signed the register.

Mary tells us of when she and her family would walk to Sunday School and church at St. John's Church, they would pick black and red raspberries on the way. Her Uncle Isaac and Aunt Minnie (#18) would wet their hankies and clean the children's faces.

Georgina Maria Porter went west to Visit her two sons in about 1921 and stayed. She died in a private nursing home in Calgary at the age of 85 and was buried in Queen's Park, Calgary, Alberta.

Child:
121. Harold Porter

Thomas was the second son of William and Elizabeth (Kenney) Porter. He and his brother David drew bricks for their family home on the homestead, Lot 16, Concession 10. They got bricks from two kilns at Lot 15, Concession 10 (Snider's Corners &ndash; now Bethesda) and at Lot 17, Concession 6. These kilns were operated by James Lowe. (Note 2)

Note 2: <u>History of the Schools of St. Vincent Township and Other Chronicles, 1847-1967</u>. P. 246

Georgina Nesbitt was a younger sister of Ellen Nesbitt Kerr, grandmother of Mary Schulz (#116).

Thomas and Georgina Porter bought 150 acres of Lot 15, Concession 10 of St. Vincent Township in 1884. In August 1886, they donated the northwest corner of this farm (85&times;15O feet) to the trustees of St. John's Methodist Church. Thomas served on the building committee and also held the office of secretary-treasurer of St. John's for a period of time.

After Harold's death in 1891, Thomas sold the farm in 1893 and moved west to Parksville, British Columbia. Georgina moved to Owen Sound and lived in one of the houses that Thomas had built.

Thomas Porter was a carpenter by trade and built two houses in the Brooke district of Owen Sound, Ontario. One house, located at 2069 &ndash; 5th Ave. W., he left to his nephew John (#114) who in turn gave it to Trinity United Church and First United Church, Owen Sound, on the condition it not be sold. The other house, located at 2056 &ndash; 4th Ave. W., he left to Mrs. Sam Walter, who looked after his wife Georgina. Both houses are standing today.

Thomas was a ratepayer with St. Johns School as this is where his son Harold attended.


121. Harold Porter b. May 17, 1879 Lot 15, Concession 10 St. Vincent Township, d. November 5, 1891 at his home. He is buried in Lakeview Cemetery, Meaford, Ontario.

Harold died at the age of 12 years with appendicitis, in his father's arms. He attended St. John's School at Lot 16, Concession 11 until his death. His picture is in front of the brick school, page 147, of <u>History of The Schools of St. Vincent Township and Other Chronicles, l847-1967</u>.

George Henry Arthur was the son of John Arthur, Sr., a farmer and a Justice of the Peace, according to the Biographical Directory of Grey County Subscribers in the <u>Historical Atlas of Grey and Bruce Counties, 1880</u> (H. Belden and Co., Publishers). John Arthur was born in County Tyrone, Ireland in 1803 and settled in Grey County in 1859. He owned Lots 20 and 21, Concession 9 of St. Vincent Township at a value of $10,000 for 200 acres.

George Henry Arthur bought 100 acres, Lot 20, Concession 10 (the south half of the lot) in 1866 from his father. In the Historical Atlas, this property was valued at $6,000 in 1880.

George and Sarah Jane Arthur later moved to Lot 17, Concession 11 of St. Vincent Township. He purchased 100 acres (the south half of the lot) in 1888 from Nathan Seaman. This farm was known as Fairview Grange. The date of their move is not exactly known, although it may have been in 1889. The reason for my guess is that George Arthur was a ratepayer of S.S. #12 (known as Street's School or Bumstead's School) in 1889. He was also a ratepayer of S.S. #11
(St. John's School) in 1889. All their children attended one or both schools. (Note 3)

Note 3: <u>History of the Schools of St. Vincent Township and Other Chronicles</u>, pages 154 and 145.

On Fairview Grange (Lot 17, Concession 11) is a beautiful stone house which still stands as a sentinel on the hill, overlooking the countryside facing the town of Meaford. Thhs house was built in 1867. The original barn was destroyed by fire in the 1960s and a new one has been built.

George Henry Arthur sold Lot 20, Concession 10 to his son Orville J. Arthur in 1910. Orville sold it to his brother George Frederick in 1912. George Frederick later sold it to John W. Jolley in 1920. This farm (Lot 20, Concession 10) was in the George Henry Arthur family name for 54 years. The house on this farm was destroyed by fire in the 1960s.

Ellis in 1926, with the condition that they would be joint tenants with a bedroom reserved for him in the house. In 1942 this farm became the property of the Meaford Tank Range, so it is now inaccessible. (To see a picture of the house on this farm, see page 85 of <u>History of The Schools of St. Vincent Township and Other Chronicles, 1847-1967</u>.)

Isaac Porter was a ratepayer with S.S. #7 (Bethesda School) in 1889, and also a ratepayer with S.S. #11 (St. John's School) in 1889.

Isaac bought the homestead from his father William in 1886. His son Herbert bought the farm in 1930 and lives there today. The family attended St. John's Methodist Church, Lot 15, Concession 10, until it closed in 1964.

Line School. (Note 8)

Note 8: <u>History of Sydenham Township &ndash; 1967</u>. Pages 77, 236-240.

Grace and Hollis Weaver had three children &ndash; Kenneth Francis, Charles Melbourne, and Raeburn Hollis Weaver. After Hollis' death in 1968, his son Raeburn owned the farm for 3 years until his death in 1971.

Kenneth and Anna Weaver owned Lot 6, Concession 3 of Sydenham Township from 1937-1970. Then they moved into Owen Sound, Ontario.

Charles Weaver served with the Canadian Armed Forces from 1941 to 1946. He took part in the Sicily Invasion from July 1943 to March 1945, then returned to England.

William Porter was born in 1898 at the homestead, Lot 16, Concession 10. He married Edith Henrietta Jolley at the Meaford parsonage, in 1920. They proceeded to the train station from the ceremony and travelled by train to Carman, Manitoba where they farmed for a few years. Edith returned to Meaford to the home of her parents (George H. &amp;
Ula Jolley) at Lot 16, Concession 11 in 1921 where Albert was born. When he was about 6 weeks old, she returned by train to Carman, Manitoba. William and Edith left Manitoba in 1923 and returned to Meaford before Louise was born.

William and Edith had five children &ndash; Albert Isaac, Edith <u>Louise</u>, Helen Elizabeth, Harold William, and Donelda Margaret Porter. All their children attended St. John's School (S.S. #11).

William bought Lot 17, Concession 10 from his father Isaac in 1930. The original buildings still stand today. However, the barn has been enlarged, adding 20 feet in the center of it. After William's death in 1950, Edith sold the farm to her son Albert. Albert farmed there for many years, selling it in 1985. This farm was in the Porter family name for 102 years, from 1883-1985. (William and Elizabeth Kenney Porter (#1) bought this farm from Robert Taylor in 1883.)

Elizabeth Kenny Porter was born in 1900 at the homestead, living for one year. She is buried in Lakeview Cemetery, Meaford, Ontario.

Isabel Josephine Porter was born in 1902 at the homestead, Lot 16, Concession 10 St. Vincent Township. She married William David Palmer who grew up on Lot 11, Concession 11 of St. Vincent Township and attended St. John's School
with Isabel. After their marriage in 1926, they moved to Cleveland, Ohio, USA. They had 4 children &ndash; Keith David, Dorothy June, Paul Duane and Margaret Evangeline Palmer.

Isaac <u>Herbert</u> Porter was born in 1906 on the family farm (Lot 16, Concession 10) and still resides there today. He married Ellen Jane (Nellie) Sinclair of Keady in 1932.

Note 9: <u>History of the Schools of St. Vincent Township and Other Chronicles, 1847-1967</u> &ndash; Pages 146,181

Herbert and Ellen had 3 children &ndash; Malcolm Isaac, Donald Shields and Marion Ellen Porter.

Ellen wrote the history of the Porter family in 1949. It is to her that we are much indebted, because without her help many years ago, this task would have been very difficult. Thank you Aunt Nellie.

The original buildings still stand on the homestead, with slight alterations.
