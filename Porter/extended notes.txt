<h2>HISTORY OF THE PORTERS</h2>
1949

William Porter, the grandfather of the George H. Arthur family, the Atkins, the Frees and the Porters was born December 28, 1821 in Wiltshire, England sailing from Bristol England as a young man for Canada taking either eight or eleven weeks to cross the ocean. He had two sisters but they never came to Canada. He worked for Hiram Bond on the 9th Line North of St. Vincent for eight dollars a month. This was the highest wage paid at that time. He borrowed money from a Mr. McKnight in Owen Sound. He went over there to make payments. The McKnights invited him to stay for dinner. The girl that worked in the home was Elizabeth Kenney. Later she became William Porter's wife.

Elizabeth Kenney was born on May 15, 1823 in Donegal, Ireland &ndash; an only child and was a servant in the Old Land. She and her mother came out here when she was around seventeen. She was raised an Anglican but later became a Methodist. She walked from either Barrie or Collingwood to Owen Sound where she worked for Mr. McKnight.

One time Mr. Porter went to see his sweetheart thinking it was Sunday, but as there were no calenders, he missed the count and it was Monday. She said "Why William where have you been? I was wearing for you."

On May 18, 1846 William Porter and Elizabeth Kenney were married. The farm on which Herb lives was their land taken from the Crown in 1846. They lived in a little log cabin southwest of the present house. When they started to farm all they had was a shilling and an axe. The table, chairs, sap buckets, spiles were all homemade whittled with a
jack knife. The cradle for the eldest, at least, was a sap-trough, a log cut in two and hollowed out.

There were always Indians lurking around. The road was only a trail like a cow path through the bush.

In those early days they had logging bees. The men, taking a team of oxen went to help the neighbours clear the land. Oxen were handier to use in bush as they did not snag themselves; only the chain to carry. The women went along for a sewing bee. In earlier days there were fine tucks down the front of the men's white shirts. Grandma Porter was an expert needlewoman and she was given the task of making these fine tucks by hand as there were no machines.

For fruit, there were wild berries growing in the clearing. These were preserved with maple sugar in stone crocks.

Grandfather took whatever he could carry of wheat to Barrie; have it ground into flour, and carry it home again. Sometimes he would take the oxen and other times walk going one day and coming home the next. It is sixty-five miles to Barrie from here. He would get tea too.

Around seventy years ago Harry Arthur can remember when they had six horses, a yoke of oxen and some big cows. The end of the cow's horn was sawn off and a brass knob screwed on to keep them from hooking. This is the only place H. Arthur ever saw them.

The present house was built in 1865 when Herb's father was four years old. The contractor was J. J. Johnson. He came from down the country. This was the first work he had done around here. Before he was through he had a number of contracts ahead of him so he moved to Meaford. When they finished building the house the contractors built the cupboard, which we got from the Aunt Ellen estate, and gave it to grandmother as a present.

Where the driving shed now stands there was a building to house implements and horses. The old barn was all on one floor. The present horse stable was built around 1900 when William was two years old.

The barn was built while grandfather William was living. Isaac Porter planed all the lumber in the horse stable and driving shed the winter before they were built.

Grandfather and grandmother had eight children &ndash; having seven children in nine years.

Grandfather and his daughter, Sarah Jane, went to the Quaker church on one horse. This church was a half mile north on the 9th Line of the Meaford Highway on the east side of the road. When they had their meetings they never spoke till the Spirit moved them.

In later years Grandma never combed her own hair. It did not matter how busy Ellen was, she would always stop to comb her mother's hair.

When Grandad wished to teasehis wife he called her Betty. Then she got riled and he chuckled to himself.

She was a short stout woman while her husband was only a medium height around 5'8". His son Isaac resembled him.

They were very fond of the grandchildren. The grandmother never left home for a long time before she died. Mary Arthur, later Mrs. A.L. Shunk, used to get up on a stool and comb the grandad's hair &ndash; it was in the long English style, and put ribbons on it. To entertain Grace, one day, the grandmother went for a ride in the phaeton &ndash; much like a buggy, only it had mud guards on the wheels and lights from tallow candles. They went around and around the field behind the barn while Grace did the driving.

At Christmas time every chimney had smoke coming from it as a sign of hospitality. The families would all come home for Christmas. In later years two families came home, maybe the Atkins and the Frees one year and the Arthurs and Tom Porters the next year. The older folk would eat in the dining room and the younger in the kitchen.

William Porter was offered lots 8 and 9 Concession ll of St. Vincent consisting of 600 acreas for $600.00 or a $1.00 an acre. But grandmother said, "No you cannot put the boys on that place for it won't grow wheat." Wheat was considered the staple crop worth $1.00 a bushel.

Both could read and write. The grandmother spent a good deal of time knitting; was very quick; rather severe, but good judgment. The grandfather was a mild man but very firm. When she died she left a grain sack of socks for Isaac. A blue pair the boys wore last summer were Isaac's wedding socks &ndash; their grandfather.

Grandfather died in June 4, 1886.

St. John's Church was built in 1886 on Thomas Porter's property. Grandmother was asked to name the Church. She named it St. John's after her son John who had died from typhoid fever in 1869 at the age of seventeen years and three months.

Church was attended regularly by every member of the household and family worship was held in the home. No newspapers were read in the home on Sundays even in Herb's earlier days. Every Sunday Herb's mother taught them the Sunday School lesson before they went to Sunday School. Bible truths were taught very impressively in those early days.

The grandmother put potatoes on to boil, take her Bible and study a chapter. By the time the potatoes were cooked she had memorized the chapter. In the speller she went over a long column, closed the book and then repeated the whole column.

After Isaac was married, the mother and Ellen lived in the dining room sleeping in the room off it. Her favourite spot was a rocking chair in front of the west window. Grandfather's clock was north of the west window and the cupboard in the southwest corner.

Grandmother died in May 17, 1909 and was buried in the same grave as her mother who died in her early eighties in Duxbury's Cemetery.

To give you a picture of William and Elizabeth's standing, we have included the Agricultural Censuses for 1851, 1861, and 1871. Note the progression of land clearance during each decade. They grew their own produce and likely used some of it for barter.

Notes from census &ndash; Owing to the wet season, the pea, Indian corn and potato crops are generally bad, almost a total failure. In many instances, squirrels and birds destroyed the crops, especially in small clearings. The land in most parts of the township is well watered by creeks and living springs. Many of these * may appear incorrect but the reason is they milked more cows in summer than they have to give in at this time. Census Taker.

112. Karl William Porter
113. Bernice Kerr Porter
114. John (Jack) Porter
115. Georgina (Jean) Eleanor Porter
116. Mary E. Porter

David was the oldest son of William and Elizabeth (Kenney) Porter. He and his brother Thomas drew bricks for their family home on the homestead, Lot 16, Concession 10. They got bricks from two kilns at Lot 15, Concession 1O (Snider's Corners &ndash; now Bethesda) and at Lot 17, Concession 6. These kilns were operated by James Lowe. (Note 1)

Note 1: <u>History of the Schools of St. Vincent Township and Other Chronicles, 1847-1967</u>. P. 246

Georgina's parents were William and Ellen (Eleanor) Nesbitt Kerr, both from the Oshawa area. They married and moved to Meaford, settling in a log house on the 11th Concession near the Big Head River (about 5 miles from Meaford). Mrs. Kerr was 17 when she married and died in 1939 at 101 years. Both Mr. &amp; Mrs. Kerr are buried in Lakeview
Cemetery. Some of their children were Georgina Maria, Olive and Harry.

David and Georgina Porter bought a 200 acre farm, Lot 18, Concession 11, St. Vincent Township in 1885. The farm was called Bayview. (This corner is still referred to as Bayview today.) David left the farm to his wife in his will.

Before David died, a man by the name of Alfred Jeffrey (born 1882) came to Canada from England on a sight-seeing trip. Mr. Jeffrey learned of David's illness, and, although he was not a farmer, he agreed to help the family. He stayed over five years. He married Olive Kerr (a sister of Georgina) and they moved to Calgary, Alberta.

After David's death, Georgina rented the farm out, as she felt it was too much responsibility for her children, and moved to Meaford, Ontario to 142 St. Vincent Street.

In 1936, 0.054 acres was taken off the front edge of the farm for widening of the highway. In 1942, Georgina Porter sold the farm to Mr. Elmer Scarrow. (This farm was in the Porter name for 57 years.)

All the children attended St. John's School at Lot 16, Concession 11. After Georgina moved to Meaford, the children attended Meaford Public School and Meaford High School.

David and Georgina's first child, a son, died at birth and was buried on their farm, as this was permissible in those days.

Karl William Porter was born on his parents' farm (Lot 18, Concession 11) in 1896. He went west by train in 1913 when he was 17 to live with his Uncle Harry Kerr on their ranch in Medicine Hat, Alberta. He stayed there for several years, then started farming on his own. His sister Mary notes that he loved the farm, and especially his animals.

Bernice, born in 1898 on the farm (Lot 18, Concession 11) was not too well in health and lived with her grandparents, William and Ellen Nesbitt Kerr, in Meaford, Ontario. She went west to visit Alfred and Olive Jeffrey in Calgary on her first holidays in about 1916. There she got a job with the Alberta Government Telephones as a telephone operator and stayed out west. In Vulcan, Alberta, Bernice met William Herman, who had a dray and taxi
business there. They married and were dairy farmers in Vulcan, Alberta area, then moved to Black Diamond, Alberta to operate a dairy.

John (Jack) Porter was born on the farm in 1900. He went to Medicine Hat, Alberta by train in 1916 to live with his Uncle Harry Kerr. He spent some time as a time keeper in a mine in British Columbia, then a grain buyer in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. He was a member of the United Church and the Masonic Lodge.

Georgina (Jean) Porter was born on the farm in 1902 and attended St. John's School, Meaford Public School, Meaford High School and Owen Sound Business College.

She worked for a while as a bookkeeper at a men's furnishings store in Owen Sound, then moved to Detroit, Michigan and later to Newark, New Jersey. She was self-employed, selling ladies', men's and children's ready-to-wear clothing.

Mary was born in 1904 at Bayview, attended St. John's School for a short time with Bill Porter and Edith Jolley. She finished school in Meaford. She and her mother went west to visit her brothers in about 1921 and both stayed. She still lives in Calgary, Alberta. Mary's grandmother, Mrs. William (Ellen) Kerr, formerly of Meaford, and then living
in Calgary, was present at Mary and William Schulz's wedding in Central United Church, Calgary. Mrs. Kerr was 96 years of age and signed the register.

Mary tells us of when she and her family would walk to Sunday School and church at St. John's Church, they would pick black and red raspberries on the way. Her Uncle Isaac and Aunt Minnie (#18) would wet their hankies and clean the children's faces.

Georgina Maria Porter went west to Visit her two sons in about 1921 and stayed. She died in a private nursing home in Calgary at the age of 85 and was buried in Queen's Park, Calgary, Alberta.

George Henry Arthur was the son of John Arthur, Sr., a farmer and a Justice of the Peace, according to the Biographical Directory of Grey County Subscribers in the <u>Historical Atlas of Grey and Bruce Counties, 1880</u> (H. Belden and Co., Publishers). John Arthur was born in County Tyrone, Ireland in 1803 and settled in Grey County in 1859. He owned Lots 20 and 21, Concession 9 of St. Vincent Township at a value of $10,000 for 200 acres.

George Henry Arthur bought 100 acres, Lot 20, Concession 10 (the south half of the lot) in 1866 from his father. In the Historical Atlas, this property was valued at $6,000 in 1880.

George and Sarah Jane Arthur later moved to Lot 17, Concession 11 of St. Vincent Township. He purchased 100 acres (the south half of the lot) in 1888 from Nathan Seaman. This farm was known as Fairview Grange. The date of their move is not exactly known, although it may have been in 1889. The reason for my guess is that George Arthur was a ratepayer of S.S. #12 (known as Street's School or Bumstead's School) in 1889. He was also a ratepayer of S.S. #11
(St. John's School) in 1889. All their children attended one or both schools. (Note 3)

Note 3: <u>History of the Schools of St. Vincent Township and Other Chronicles</u>, pages 154 and 145.

On Fairview Grange (Lot 17, Concession 11) is a beautiful stone house which still stands as a sentinel on the hill, overlooking the countryside facing the town of Meaford. Thhs house was built in 1867. The original barn was destroyed by fire in the 1960s and a new one has been built.

George Henry Arthur sold Lot 20, Concession 10 to his son Orville J. Arthur in 1910. Orville sold it to his brother George Frederick in 1912. George Frederick later sold it to John W. Jolley in 1920. This farm (Lot 20, Concession 10) was in the George Henry Arthur family name for 54 years. The house on this farm was destroyed by fire in the 1960s.

In 1911, George Henry Arthur sold Lot 17, Concession 11 to two of his sons &ndash; the west or back half (50 acres) to George Frederick Arthur, the east or front half (50 acres) to Bernard Stanley Arthur. In 1912 George F. Arthur sold his part of the farm to Bernard Arthur. Bernard owned the whole farm until 1948 when he and his son sold it to Frederick I. Genoe, who in turn sold it in 1949 to Clarence Whitfield. This farm (Lot 17, Concession 11) was in the Arthur family name for 60 years.

In the 1871 St. Vincent Township census George Henry Arthur and Sarah Jane Arthur are listed in the following way.

<blockquote>George Henry Arthur age 32, Wesleyan Methodist, Irish descent, a farmer
Sarah Jane Arthur age 20, English descent
Elizabeth Arthur age 2, Irish descent

They owned 100 acres of Concession 10, Lot 20, of which 70 acres were improved. The farm had 1 house, 2 barns and stables, 1 carriage and sleigh, 2 waggons and sleds, 1 plough and cultivator, 1 fanning mill.

In 1871, 10 swine were killed
400 lbs. butter made
60 lbs. homemade cheese made
70 lbs. wool
20 cords firewood cut</blockquote>

Elizabeth Arthur was born in 1869 on the farm at Lot 20, Concession 10, St. Vincent Township. She married Phillip <u>Foster</u> Taylor. They lived in Toronto and had two children &ndash; Arthur and Evangeline. Foster Taylor joined the Toronto Police Force on April 23, 1888 at the age of 29 years and unmarried. He was 6 feet, 3/4 inches tall, born in Ireland and of the Episcopalian faith. He resigned from the Toronto Police Force in 1905, giving a total of 17 years service. Nothing else is known of this family.

William <u>Henry</u> (Harry) Arthur was born in 1871 on the farm at Lot 20, Concession 10 St. Vincent Township. He married Mary A. Howe, a daughter of Provincial Cabinet Minister S.L. Howe. They lived in Meaford and had 2 children, Lyness Rupert Francis (Robert L.) and William Almyra Porter Arthur. Harry owned King Edward Livery on Trowbridge Street in Meaford from 1911 to 1922. Fire destroyed the stable in the 1930s. The house they lived in is still standing &ndash; 40 Trowbridge Street, beside the present day Church of the Nazarene. Both their sons moved to Buffalo after World War I, Robert working with the Liberty National Bank and Trust Co. as Vice-President.

Mary Beatrice Arthur was born in 1873 on Lot 20, Concession 10, St. Vincent Township. She married Abraham Lincoln Shunk of St. Vincent Township in 1901. Rev. Shunk was ordained in the Gospel Workers' Church on December 17, 1914. He preached in Collingwood and Shelburne, Ontario. He retired to Meaford in 1928 because of failing eyesight. The Shunks had no children. (The Gospel Workers' Church later became part of the Church of the Nazarene.)

Robert and Ethel lived on this farm after their marriage, building a second part on the house. They had an agreement with Robert's father to supply him with staples, etc. When his father died, Robert paid each family member a specified sum and the farm was his. The farm was sold to Clarence Fligg and his family after Robert <u>Arthur</u> Jolley's death in 1957. Robert took an active part in agricultural matters and educational circles. He was also a devout church worker with the Gospel Workers. His obituary states "he was highly esteemed, and a man with whom it was a pleasure to know and associate". Robert and Ethel had six children &ndash; an infant son who died at birth, Robert <u>Arthur</u>, George <u>Kenneth</u> Falconer, William <u>Frederick</u>, Muriel Irene, Harold Porter Jolley. After Robert's death, Ethel moved to her daughter Muriel's home. Robert Jolley was a ratepayer for St. John's School, where all his children attended. Several of his children became school teachers.

The Atkins farm was located at Lot 26, Concession 9 of St. Vincent Township, part of the Irish Mountain. This was where Levi Atkins grew up with his parents, Joseph and Ellen Atkins. Joseph Atkins purchased 100 acres, the south half of the lot, from the Crown, then willed it to his son Levi in 1900. Levi sold the farm to his daughter and son-in-law, Hattie and Frederick G. Ellis in 1926, with the condition that they would be joint tenants with a bedroom reserved for him in the house. In 1942 this farm became the property of the Meaford Tank Range, so it is now inaccessible. (To see a picture of the house on this farm, see page 85 of <u>History of The Schools of St. Vincent Township and Other Chronicles, 1847-1967</u>.)
